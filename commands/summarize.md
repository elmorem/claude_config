Please generate a comprehensive session summary following this structure:

  1. **Analyze This Session**: Review our conversation history and identify:
     - All tasks completed
     - Key decisions made
     - Files created/modified
     - Problems solved
     - Technical insights gained

  2. **Current State Assessment**: Determine:
     - Project current status
     - Active technology stack
     - Architecture decisions in place
     - Testing approach
     - Known issues or blockers

  3. **Context Compaction**: Distill the most important information that would
   help in future sessions:
     - Critical implementation details
     - Important patterns established
     - Performance considerations
     - Security implementations

  4. **Roadmap Update**: Based on current progress, identify:
     - Immediate next steps for next session
     - Short-term goals (1-2 weeks)
     - Medium-term objectives (1 month)
     - Dependencies and blockers

  5. **Generate File**: Create a file in TODO directory named
  `summary-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md` with the following structure:

  Please ensure the TODO directory exists before creating the file. Use the
  current date and time for the filename in format:
  summary-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md

  Purpose

  This command serves as a session bridge that:
  - Preserves critical context between sessions
  - Maintains project momentum
  - Provides clear next-step guidance
  - Creates searchable project history
  - Prevents loss of important decisions and insights

  Best Practices

  - Run at the end of significant work sessions
  - Use when switching between different projects
  - Generate before taking breaks from a project
  - Create after major architectural decisions
  - Run before important milestones or releases

  File Location

  Files are created in: TODO/summary-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md

  Integration

  This command works best when combined with:
  - Regular todo list updates
  - Git commit summaries
  - Project documentation
  - Architecture decision records
